## Provide Feedback on a Docs Page

Every page on docs.canton.network has two feedback buttons in the footer:
- `Suggest edits`
- `Raise issue`

### Suggest edits:
Use this to propose a direct change to the page, fix a typo, update a code sample, improve wording, etc.

**How it works:**

- Click “Suggest edits” in the footer of any page.
- GitHub opens the source file for that exact page.
- Fork the repo, make your edits, and open a Pull Request.
- Canton docs team reviews and merges accepted changes if all checks out.

### Raise Issue:
Use this to report a problem or request new content without editing the source yourself.

**How it works:**

- Click “Raise Issue” in the footer of any page.
- A GitHub Issue opens *Pre-filled* with the Path of the page you were on.
- Describe in detail what's wrong or missing along with the source of information to verify and submit.
- The team reviews it and responds.


## Local Development

### Prerequisites

Either:

- [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/)
- [`nix`](https://nixos.org/download/)

OR:

- [Node.js 24](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (note that `mintlify` is not currently compatible with Node.js 26)
- [Python 3.14](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you are running any of the machinery for syncing snippets or updating generated docs

### Authoring and generated content

Edit pages, navigation, and images in `docs-main/`, either directly or through
the Mintlify editor. Ordinary content has no separate source copy and is not
rewritten by documentation generation.

Network-dependent sections use templates in `docs-main/snippets/networkvars/`.
Edit those templates, then run `npm run generate:network-variable-tabs` to update
the marked `NETWORKVARS_START` / `NETWORKVARS_END` regions. Generation preserves
content outside those regions. Edit generated reference pages through their
owning generators, as before.

Run `npm run validate:network-variable-tabs` to check generated regions without
modifying files. Direct edits inside those regions fail validation; edit the
referenced template instead. Ordinary page edits and new images do not require
regeneration.

### Running the dev server

```bash
direnv allow
cd docs-main && mintlify dev
```

The site will be available at http://localhost:3000.

### Check for broken links

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Generate external snippets

External snippet extraction from source repositories is documented in [config/snippet-config/update-workflows.md](config/snippet-config/update-workflows.md). Use that workflow when updating snippet configs under `config/snippet-config/` or regenerating checked-in snippets under `docs-main/snippets/external/`.

Run this whenever you add, remove, or update a snippet source in `config/snippet-config/`, or when you need to pull in changes from an upstream repo (such as Canton or Splice) that are referenced by existing snippets.

```bash
npm run generate:external-snippets -- --list
npm run generate:external-snippets -- canton --source-dir ../canton
```
